## Project Overview (Neutrino)

This project aims to develop a user-friendly news aggregator application that empowers users to:

**Customize their news feed:** Select preferred topics, news sources, and filter by category.

**Be aware of potential bias:** Integrate with bias detection tools or models to highlight potential bias within news articles.

**Become informed readers:** Promote critical thinking skills by encouraging users to consider potential bias in news reporting.

### Key Features (Planned)

- **News Feed Customization:** Curate personalized feeds based on user preferences.
- **Bias Detection:** Integrated with existing bias detection APIs or potentially train a custom model (advanced).
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A visually appealing and intuitive interface for easy navigation and understanding of bias indicators.

#### Additional Features (Optional)

Explore functionalities like user accounts, saved articles, search functionalities, and social sharing.

### Technology Stack 

- **Frontend:** React 
- **Backend:** Node.js 
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Version Control:** Git

### Project Plan

#### Phase 1: Planning & Research (Days 1-10):

- Day 1-3: Define project goals, target audience, research existing news aggregators & bias detection tools.
- Day 4-5: Create user flow diagrams, sketch low-fidelity wireframes, research UI inspiration.
- Day 6-7: Choose a technology stack, set up development environment, explore frontend frameworks.
- Day 8-9: Research news APIs and bias detection options, finalize chosen APIs, explore user authentication methods.
- Day 10: Write a blog post introducing the project (optional), outline a basic deployment plan.

#### Phase 2: Frontend Development I (Days 11-20):

- Day 11-13: Learn basic functionalities of your chosen frontend framework, develop a basic layout for the app's main screen.
- Day 14-15: Build a component for displaying individual news articles, implement basic functionality to display sample articles.
- Day 16-17: Style the app interface using CSS or a chosen styling framework, research best practices for mobile-friendly design.
- Day 18-19: Explore UI animations/micro-interactions, briefly explore unit testing concepts for frontend components.
- Day 20: Integrate a news API to retrieve and display sample news articles.

#### Phase 3: Backend Development & Integration (Days 21-30):

- Day 21-22: Learn basic functionalities of your chosen backend framework, explore data storage options.
- Day 23-24: Choose a database solution, explore setup process, plan user data security and privacy measures.
- Day 25-26: Develop backend API endpoints for user management (if applicable), integrate bias detection API (or start building a custom model - advanced).
- Day 27-28: Implement error handling mechanisms for potential user-facing issues, explore basic deployment platforms like Heroku.
- Day 29-30: Test backend functionalities, begin integrating frontend and backend for data exchange.

#### Phase 4: User Interface Refinement & Additional Features (Days 31-40):

- Day 31-32: Refine the user interface based on usability principles, explore accessibility best practices.
- Day 33-34: Implement user accounts and login system (optional), explore options for user feedback mechanisms.
- Day 35-36: Develop search functionality for news articles within the app, consider ways to incentivize user engagement.
- Day 37-38: Explore basic app analytics tools to track user behavior, write documentation for completed functionalities.
- Day 39-40: Conduct thorough testing of all app functionalities (frontend & backend), fix identified bugs.

#### Phase 5: Deployment & Promotion (Days 41-45):

- Day 41-43: Deploy the app to chosen platform and test functionality in a live environment.
